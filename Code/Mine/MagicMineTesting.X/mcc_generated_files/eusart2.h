  @File Name
    eusart2.h

  @Summary
    This is the generated header file for the EUSART2 driver using MPLAB(c) Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides APIs for driver for EUSART2.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB(c) Code Configurator - v3.00
        Device            :  PIC18F26K22
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 1.35
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 3.20

  @Summary
    Initialization routine that takes inputs from the EUSART2 GUI.

  @Description
    This routine initializes the EUSART2 driver.
    This routine must be called before any other EUSART2 routine is called.

    None

  @Param
    None

  @Returns
    None

  @Summary
    Read a byte of data from the EUSART2.

  @Description
    This routine reads a byte of data from the EUSART2.

  @Preconditions
    EUSART2_Initialize() function should have been called
    before calling this function. The transfer status should be checked to see
    if the receiver is not empty before calling this function.
	
	EUSART2_DataReady is a macro which checks if any byte is received.
	Call this macro before using this function.

  @Param
    None

  @Returns
    A data byte received by the driver.
	
  @Example
	<code>
            void main(void) {
								// initialize the device
								SYSTEM_Initialize();
								uint8_t data;
								
								// Enable the Global Interrupts
								INTERRUPT_GlobalInterruptEnable();
								
								// Enable the Peripheral Interrupts
								INTERRUPT_PeripheralInterruptEnable();
								
								printf("\t\tTEST CODE\n\r");		//Enable redirect STDIO to USART before using printf statements
								printf("\t\t---- ----\n\r");
								printf("\t\tECHO TEST\n\r");
								printf("\t\t---- ----\n\n\r");
								printf("Enter any string: ");
								do{
								data = EUSART1_Read();		// Read data received
								EUSART_Write(data);			// Echo back the data received
								}while(!EUSART1_DataReady);		//check if any data is received
